# RFID-Tracking-Project
A demo for the RFID Web-App I created as an Intern at Motorola Solutions 

To view the demo open 'oldDash.html' and click through the tabs at the top to view all functionality. Also if you click the 3 vertical dots in the top right corner, dialog boxes popup and allow you to change the maximum number of minuets a member can stay in the heat(20 min is default and is used to detrermine width of red bar in "Heat Point Highlights" Section on the Dashboard Tab), as well as adjust the names of the two checkpoints (Incident Staging and Resource Control are default values)
